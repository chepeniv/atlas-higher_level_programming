## Requirements

- first line of all files should be `#!/usr/bin/python3`
- code should use pycodestyle (version 2.7.+)
- a documentation is not a single word, it’s a complete sentence explaining what’s the purpose of the module, class or method (the length of it will be verified)
- all modules should have documentation : 
		`python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").__doc__)'`
- all classes should have documentation : 
		`python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").myclass.__doc__)'`
- all functions (inside and outside a class) should have a documentation :
		`python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").my_function.__doc__)'`\
		`python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").myclass.my_function.__doc__)'`
